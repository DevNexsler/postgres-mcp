        RECEIVED action); resume()'s is just returning the row's current
        result unchanged (worker.py only ever calls resume() for
        DEPENDENCY_WAIT/PREPARED/RETRY_READY, but resume() is a public
        method with no such guarantee from other callers, so its historical
        "return the row as-is" fallback for any other state must not
        silently become _preflight()). All three routes -- including
        `otherwise` -- can reach _dispatch()'s adapter.invoke()/
        adapter.poll() provider I/O, so all three are covered by the same
        try/except below.

        A post-dispatch exception (e.g. a network timeout *after* the
        provider already accepted the HTTP request -- the row is durably
        DISPATCHING with a lease by the time adapter.invoke() runs, since
        claim()+transition() to DISPATCHING happen before it) must never
        escape to the MCP caller as a raised error: FastMCP wraps any
        uncaught exception as "Error executing tool outbound_action: ...",
        and the CDS reconciler's rejection-prefix rule treats that wrapper
        as proof nothing was sent. If a real send's post-accept timeout
        propagated that far, the reconciler would uncount a REAL send and
        let the wake complete while the message was actually delivered --
        exactly the false negative the prefix rule is only safe without.

        So: catch broadly here, log at ERROR (wake + action id, for
        operator visibility), and return whatever the row's durable state
        already is -- DISPATCHING/RECONCILING with a lease, recovered by the
        existing lease-expiry/reconcile/worker machinery, same as any other
        expired-lease crash recovery. This restores the invariant that an
        MCP error wrapper strictly implies "rejected before any provider
        interaction": context load/validation (in execute(), everything
        before this call) is deliberately NOT covered by this except clause
        and still raises, so a true pre-dispatch rejection keeps the error
        wrapper the reconciler depends on.

        granted to the gateway's runtime role in migrations/120_outbound_action_terminal_wake_boundary.sql:550-551)
        rather than inventing a new one. That function's own precondition --
        an evidence-resolved `outbound_action_resolutions` row for this
        action (067:1221-1228) -- is written by resolve_outbound_action_from_evidence,
        which IS granted to the gateway's runtime role (migrations/
        079_runtime_tenantcloud_privilege_boundary.sql:427,459-475), so this
        is not a privilege wall. The real blocker is a lifecycle/evidence
        mismatch: resolve_outbound_action_from_evidence only accepts a row
        already in 'manual_review' (067:1160-1163) and requires real
        provider-side non-acceptance evidence (a 64-hex hash, a non-empty
        reference, evidence_kind='authoritative_non_acceptance', 067:1164-1173)
        -- neither of which a traffic-control block has: it goes straight to
        'definitive_failed' from a live/pending state, never through
        'manual_review', and there is no provider disposition to attest to,
        only an internal recipient-safety policy decision. So an override
        resend can only succeed once an operator has independently routed
        this action through manual_review and evidence-resolved it; until
        then this returns None and the caller stays on the original terminal
        result instead of crashing on the unhandled precondition-violation
        exception. Closing that gap for a fully autonomous, zero-operator
        unblock needs a new Comm-Data-Store migration (e.g. a successor path
        keyed on error_category='traffic_blocked' instead of an evidence
        resolution) -- out of scope for this worktree.

        The successor's context is the SAME `context` already loaded for
        this call (not re-derived via `_verified_context`): the successor
        copies wakeup_event_id/action_role/canonical_scope/canonical_context/
        recipient_scope/provider_account/routing_policy_version/operation/
        intent_kind/appointment_slot/arguments/payload_hash verbatim from the
        parent row (067:1247-1264), so nothing about the wake-derived context
        actually changed -- only `action_id` (next effect_ordinal) did.
        `_verified_context()` would be the wrong tool here: it re-derives
        action_id from the wake via the client-side uid formula, which is
        always ordinal 0 (context.py:299), so it would report every
        successor as a context mismatch.
